# Quick-Quiz

GenAI Quiz engine leverages generative AI to instantly generate customized quizzes on any given topic, eliminating the need for manual question creation. Users simply enter a topic, and the AI crafts a full quiz complete with multiple-choice, multiple-select, true/false type questions. 
Beyond simple question generation, the platform integrates an advanced grading and analysis system. After a user completes a quiz, it not only provides a score but also gives detailed feedback on correct and incorrect answers, highlighting areas of strength and weakness.

We will use Node.js for the backend.
